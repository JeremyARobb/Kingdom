# Kingdom

kingdom is a micro managing game, the only two things you will ever say are 'yes' or 'no' but dont let that fool you towards its content.
Kingdom is a micro managing game, you have four things to keep in check, your kingdoms money, defense, food, and happiness. If any of the
first 3 mentioned falls bellow 0 you will loose. if any of the 3 go above 100, it will be set to 30, causing a great shortage of that resource.
every "year" you will get a prompt, lets say it says "A drought came by, we need to buy food for the kingdom" you will have to judge what
it will do, I would assume if you DID buy food for the kingdom your food will go up but money will go down, vise versa if you say no. 
as the game progresses more and more options will arrise.

one more thing, the game is completly random, every "year" a random option from a pool of up to 20-25 different options will be chosen
meaning no run is the same, an easy way you can see this is if you hit play over and over you will see the prompt will change each time.
